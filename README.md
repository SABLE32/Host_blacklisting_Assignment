Only valid for windows users.

This is a step by step guide of how to use the script above. 
First, it will prompt the user for a fully qualified domain address to edit. (The user must enter a valid FQDA or it will error out.)

The script will check if the FQDN already exsists and prompt the user what they want done. Valid entries  
include D or M. D will delete the entry and M will allow you to modify the entry.
